# Wrecking Pila

## "Veni quasi wrecking pila"

This is a simple mod that adds decisions and events to:

- remove all buildings of a type for your country
- remove all buildings of a type for your ai subjects
- exploit the taxes of all the available provinces having the choice between core and territorial provinces

**TGE supported!**

**NOT Ironman Compatible**

Any suggestions or questions feel free to ask!

## Notes

If you use this mod you are forced to use my decision to exploit **taxes**. Because the base game does not give a way for mods to find if a province was exploited or not.

**Sailors and manpower exploitation is unchanged.**

## Road map

- Add events for every specific subject that you have
- Exploiting taxes for your vassals?
- Automatic event to exploit taxes

## Compatibility

Any mod that does not change the `00_scripted_functions.txt` file in `common/scripted_function` folder is compatible.
