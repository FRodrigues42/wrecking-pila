# Wrecking Pila

## "Veni quasi wrecking pila"

This is a simple mod that adds decisions and events to:

- remove all buildings of a type for your country cores and territories
- remove all buildings of a type for your ai subjects
- exploit the taxes of all the available provinces having the choice between core and territorial provinces
- automatic event to remember you to exploit taxes

**TGE supported!**

**NOT Ironman Compatible**

Any suggestions or questions feel free to ask!

## Notes

If you use this mod you are forced to use my decision to exploit **taxes**. Because the base game does not give a way for mods to check if a province was exploited or not.

But if you want to use the building options but use the base game exploitation UI you can deactivate this mod's exploitation by using the option `Permanently Deactivate` in and only in the first time you use the menu.

**Sailors and manpower exploitation is unchanged.**

## Road map

- Add a option for every specific subject that you have
- Exploiting taxes for your vassals?

## Compatibility with other mods

- Any mod that does not change the `can_exploit_tax` function in `scripted_functions`.
- If a mod changes the exploit defines `EXPLOIT_COOLDOWN_MONTHS` and `EXPLOIT_ADM_INCOME` this mod can't detect the new values.
- It does not detect any added buildings except `TGE`.
